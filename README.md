----------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzed the HR employee attendance data of Atliq over some period i.e. analyze Apr 2022, May 2022 and June 2022 data and compare the changes in employee interest for WFO, WFH, etc.

Problem Statement: Considering myself working as a data analyst in a company called Atliq.

They are going to start the office on a daily basis and want their employees to come and work from the company before they want to conduct a survey to understand the interest of the employees for WFO(Work from office), WFH(work from home), and Sick leave percentage. 

As a data analyst, I am provided with an Attendance_sheet of employees dataset which contains information about the employee's attendance for 3 months.

I was asked to analyze this data to provide insights about the employees presene%, WFH%, and SL(Sick leave)%. And a short and preliminary analysis of the data.  By examining various data points, such as attendance records, leave history and work schedules, the aim is to understand the factors influencing employee presence and identify patterns that can impact organizational productivity and employee engagement.
